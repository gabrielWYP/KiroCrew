/**
 * Where a comment composer's typed-but-unsent text lives between teardowns the
 * toolbar cannot guard (a chat-slot switch replaces the whole side panel; a
 * page navigation unmounts the artifact page). One store per host document
 * (`key`), one slot per passage inside it (`anchor` + `start`), so drafts on two
 * passages of one file coexist and neither can overwrite or clear the other.
 *
 * Two layers: `sessionStorage` (survives a reload of this tab) and an in-memory
 * snapshot per key (survives a refusing storage — quota, private mode — and is
 * what a fresh instance over the same key in the SAME tab reads). The snapshot
 * also carries TOMBSTONES: a slot this tab cleared stays cleared even when the
 * storage write that recorded the deletion was refused, so a stale storage
 * record can never resurrect a draft of a comment that was already posted. A
 * later write to the same slot lifts its tombstone.
 *
 * A slot can be HELD while the host has that draft's post in flight: a held
 * slot reads as empty and refuses writes, so a second composer instance over
 * the same passage (the side panel's full-screen layer, opened mid-post) does
 * not restore the pending text and re-post it. Holds count: a passage with two
 * posts outstanding (a box closed mid-flight, a new box posted over the same
 * text) stays held until the LAST one releases. The flight's own settle then
 * clears the slot (success) or leaves it (refusal).
 *
 * Every operation is non-throwing: a full or refusing storage is a mundane
 * condition, not a crash.
